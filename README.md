# Drink

### Description 

The "Drink" application was created for the former work behind the bar. 
Often hotel guests asked to create a drink based on one or two ingredients served by him.
Not knowing the recipes, the bartender was forced to search the Internet for a particular drink.
This application is intended to make it easier to search for drinks by name or by ingredient.
The application searches for drinks using the free API, which provides a json file with the searched drinks and displays them.
